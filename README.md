# Getting Started with Diagnosis App

git clone https://github.com/MarcoRovell/GPT-Query-App.git
--> input your own API key
cd diagnosis
npm start

# What does it do?

This application takes your symptoms and other information and
uses LangChain OpenAI API to query the data you input. The response
will be a list or sometimes even a sole diagnosis based on your data.

# Will I need anything else?

Yes, like specified above, you will need to input your own API key.
You can do this by going to OpenAI website and creating a new secret key,
and add some credit balance. This won't be much money, and $1 will be more than 
enough for hundreds of uses.
